# ESP32_Game
 A boat game that runs on an ESP32
 It is implemented using FreeRTOS and the Arduino IDE.
 It uses separate tasks in FreeRTOS's scheduler to handle inputs and update the ships, cannon balls, and led.
 
 It is a game where you control a ship and dodge islands and other ships.
 Use 'up' to turn up, 'down' to turn down, 'left' to turn left, 'right' to turn right.
 Use 'faster' to speed up, and 'slower' to slow down.
 Use 'port' to fire left, and 'star' to fire right.
